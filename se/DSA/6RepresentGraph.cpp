Problem Statement: There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and
city B then there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight takes
to reach city B from A or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a graph. The
node can be represented by airport name or name of the city. Use adjacency list representation of
the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the graph. Justify the storage representation
used.
